# GitHub Cards App

The purpose of this application is to search for people by their username on the Github platform. In the search bar, you simply type in the username of the person you are trying to find. Once you press 'Enter' or click on the button, you will generate the user's profile image, their username and their location.


## Getting Started

There are two ways in which you can access the files in this repository. You can either clone the files with the git clone command or by downloading the zip file onto your computer. Once you've download the files, you need to acess the dependencies by running ```npm i``` on your command line.
